 * @brief Geometric utility functions for computing centroids, volumes,
 *        and characteristic lengths of basic shapes (triangles,
 *        tetrahedra, polygons, and polyhedra).
 *
 * This header declares shape-related routines used throughout the
 * finite-volume framework. They provide centroid, volume/surface, and
 * characteristic length computations for 2D and 3D shapes.
 *
 * Functions are used by mesh preprocessing routines to compute element
 * properties such as centroid locations, surface vectors, and volumes.
